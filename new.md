Currently I help [Matthew Caesar](https://caesar.web.engr.illinois.edu/) with his projects in large scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) research.

Some of the tasks I have helped with are:

- QA
  - Caesar's research focuses on emulating IoT devices through the use of a virtual reality simulation paired with simulated IoT devices, such as Arduinos
  - With the moving parts, I help test the system for stability and reliability
- Server Installation
  - With the moving parts needed for a large scale project, there arises a need for a server to house and fetch the user data from, and I help maintain the server to ensure that it says online
- Outreach
  - Our hope for this simulation is to get the younger generations interested in working with technology not normally presented within the classroom, such as the Arduino
  - To do so, I reach out to nearby high schools to ask to present and give demonstrations
