Like I said before, I am currently a senior in Computer Science (CS). I currently work in [research under Matthew Caesar](/research/) as an Undergraduate researcher. I was a GM for the [Illini Metagamers](https://illini-rp.net/), a club dedicated to board games and D&D.

The following are professional fields I am currently interested in:
- Networking
  - Dealing with how computers and devices interact and "talk" with each other
- Virtual reality
  - Different applications for emulation us VR (e.g. Military/Healthcare simulations)
- Game Development
- Technology Education
  - Focusing on the education of younger generations to generate interest in future technologies
